Microservices(Multiple Stack) vs Monolithic application (One stack)

Monolithic application => one big applicatiion which includes all modules together
When demand arises we do either horizontal scaling or vertical scaling
horizontal scaling =>increase same identical machines 
vertical scaling => increase RAM power or adding servers on top of it

The advantage of microservices is we can extend only particular services like search and payment when they are needed most that other services


Uses:
1)Team Dependencies
2)Scalability
3)
